# m-Myopic Optimal Configuration
# ============================================================================
# Baseline: Modified Myopic Caching
#
# This configuration achieved validation score 0.625 among 25 tested
# configurations on a 10,000-query validation dataset.
#
# Grid Search Ranges:
#   update_interval: {30, 45, 60, 90, 120}
#   priority_threshold: {0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60}
# ============================================================================

method: "m-Myopic"
validation_score: 0.625

# ============================================================================
# m-Myopic Parameters
# ============================================================================
# m-Myopic uses periodic updates and priority-based caching.
# It makes "myopic" (short-sighted) decisions based on immediate utility
# without considering long-term access patterns.
# ============================================================================

update_interval: 45
# Description: Time interval for periodic context updates
# Unit: seconds
# Interpretation: All cached context items are refreshed every 45 seconds
# Rationale: Balances freshness with update overhead
# Impact: Shorter interval → fresher data but higher cost
#         Longer interval → lower cost but staler data

priority_threshold: 0.50
# Description: Minimum priority score for caching a context item
# Range: [0, 1]
# Interpretation: Only items with priority ≥ 0.50 are cached
# Formula: priority = f(recency, size, query_frequency)
# Impact: Higher threshold → more selective caching
#         Lower threshold → cache more items

# ============================================================================
# Caching Strategy
# ============================================================================
# m-Myopic operates in fixed time intervals:
#
# Every update_interval seconds:
#   1. Refresh all cached items (fetch from providers)
#   2. Compute priority for each potential cache item
#   3. Cache items with priority ≥ priority_threshold
#   4. Evict items with priority < priority_threshold
#
# Between updates:
#   - Serve from cache (may become stale)
#   - No dynamic refresh decisions
#   - No adaptive threshold adjustment
#
# This "myopic" approach is simple but can lead to:
#   - Higher cache expired ratio (items go stale between updates)
#   - Missed opportunities (no adaptive refresh for frequently accessed items)
#   - Unnecessary updates (refreshes rarely accessed items)
# ============================================================================

# ============================================================================
# Common Parameters (All Methods)
# ============================================================================

cache_size: 500
# Description: Maximum number of context items in cache

warmup_queries: 1000
# Description: Number of queries to establish initial priority estimates

# ============================================================================
# Performance on Test Set (50,000 queries)
# ============================================================================
# Results reported in paper Section V:
#   Cache Hit Ratio (CHR): 58.2%
#   Cache Expired Ratio (CER): 28.9%
#   Response Time (RT): 215 ms
#   Cache Refresh Ratio (CRR): 65.3%
#
# Note: This method has the highest CER due to periodic (non-adaptive)
#       refresh strategy, resulting in stale data between update intervals.
