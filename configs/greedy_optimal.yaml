# Grid Search Ranges:
#   window_size: {200, 250, 300, 350, 400}

# ============================================================================
# m-Greedy Parameters
# ============================================================================
# m-Greedy maintains a sliding window of recent queries and uses
# exponentially decaying access frequency to make caching decisions.
# ============================================================================

window_size: 300
# Description: Size of the query history window
# Unit: number of queries
# Interpretation: Only the most recent 300 queries are considered for
#                 frequency calculations
# Impact: Larger window → more stable but less adaptive
#         Smaller window → more adaptive but potentially noisy

refresh_threshold: 0.40
# Description: Freshness threshold for triggering refresh
# Range: [0, 1]
# Formula: if freshness(CI) < refresh_threshold, then refresh
# Interpretation: Context items below 40% freshness are refreshed
# Note: Freshness calculated as time-based decay similar to CF

decay_factor: 0.85
# Description: Exponential decay rate for access frequency
# Range: [0, 1]
# Formula: frequency(t) = frequency(t-1) · decay_factor + current_access
# Interpretation: Access counts decay by 15% per time unit
# Impact: Higher decay → favor recent accesses more
#         Lower decay → maintain long-term access history

# ============================================================================
# Caching Strategy
# ============================================================================
# m-Greedy evicts the item with:
#   - Lowest decayed access frequency, OR
#   - Freshness below refresh_threshold (refreshed instead of cached)
#
# Decision logic:
#   1. Compute decayed frequency for each cached item
#   2. Check freshness against threshold
#   3. If fresh and frequently accessed → keep
#   4. If fresh but rarely accessed → candidate for eviction
#   5. If stale → refresh or evict based on frequency
